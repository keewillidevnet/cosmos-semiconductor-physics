# Executive Summary

## Cosmos for Semiconductor Physics (CSP)

**A Physics-Native Foundation Model for Semiconductor Fabrication Innovation**

---

### The Opportunity

The semiconductor industry ($600B+ annually) has reached fundamental physical limits. Current AI tools accelerate existing workflows but cannot discover fundamentally new processes or device architectures.

**CSP fills this gap** — a generative AI system that understands semiconductor physics deeply enough to propose innovations humans wouldn't conceive.

---

### What Exists Today

| NVIDIA Product | What It Does | What It Can't Do |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|
| ChipNeMo | Writes Verilog, finds docs | No fabrication physics |
| cuLitho | 40-60x mask optimization speedup | Doesn't discover new methods |
| Cosmos | Physics models for robotics | Not trained on semiconductor physics |

**The gap: No AI can generate novel semiconductor fabrication approaches.**

---

### What We Propose

**Cosmos for Semiconductor Physics** — a foundation model that:

1. Encodes multi-physics phenomena (EUV, plasma, quantum transport, thermal)
2. Generates novel device architectures given target specs
3. Proposes process flows for structures not in training data
4. Predicts manufacturability before fab validation

---

### Why NVIDIA

- **Compute infrastructure**: DGX Cloud, NeMo framework
- **TSMC relationship**: cuLitho in production, data-sharing exists
- **Strategic alignment**: NVIDIA depends on TSMC's continued scaling
- **Jensen's vision**: "AI is infrastructure" — CSP extends this to the industry that makes AI possible

### Value Creation

| Scenario | Value |
|----------|-------|
| 5% yield improvement | $500M-1B/year |
| 1-generation process extension | $5-10B |
| New transistor architecture | $50-100B+ |

---

### The Ask

1. **Initial discussion** with NVIDIA Research / NVentures
2. **Technical deep-dive** on architecture and training strategy
3. **TSMC introduction** to explore partnership structure
4. **Phase 1 funding** for proof-of-concept development

---

### Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Milestone |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Foundation | 12 months | Physics encoder prototypes |
| Integration | 12 months | TSMC validation on contained use case |
| Scale | 12 months | Full multi-physics model |
| Deployment | 12 months | Production integration |
